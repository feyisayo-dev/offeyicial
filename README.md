This is my first social media site, and I hope it goes well. I have encountered several challenges along the way, including issues with the sqlsrv extension and debugging my code. I have also come across some unnecessary files like test.php and design.php, which were used for testing purposes.

Discovered an issue with real-time updates for videos, causing the page to reload multiple times and interrupting the video playback. It's quite frustrating and needs to be fixed.
Noticed excessive caching, which impacts the performance of the site. I will investigate and optimize the caching mechanisms.
Encountered difficulties while seeking help on Stack Overflow. Some users downvote questions without providing helpful answers. It can be quite frustrating.

Reached a point where I have implemented everything I know. However, I realized that I forgot about the news feed functionality. I would appreciate any assistance or guidance in implementing this feature.
Challenges Faced
SQL Server Connection: Initially, I encountered an error stating "Call to undefined function sqlsrv_connect()." This was resolved by ensuring that the sqlsrv extension was installed and properly configured in PHP.

Missing Icons: There was an issue with missing icons on the site. After investigating, I discovered that the paths to the icon files were incorrect. Fixing the paths resolved the problem, and the icons are now displayed correctly.

Real-Time Updates: While implementing real-time updates for the chat functionality, I noticed that videos caused the page to reload multiple times, resulting in interruptions and video restarts. I need to find a solution to this issue to ensure smooth video playback.

Caching and Performance: Excessive caching can impact the performance of the site. I plan to optimize the caching mechanisms to improve the overall speed and responsiveness of the application.

Seeking Help on Stack Overflow: Unfortunately, I faced challenges while seeking assistance on Stack Overflow. Some users downvoted my questions without providing any helpful responses. It can be discouraging, but I will continue to persevere and seek assistance from other resources.

Next Steps
Moving forward, I have identified the following tasks:

Implement Like, Share, and Comment Functionality: It is essential to add these features to enhance user engagement and interaction with the site.

Resolve Real-Time Update Issues for Videos: Find a solution to the problem of video interruptions and multiple page reloads when implementing real-time updates.

Optimize Caching and Performance: Analyze and optimize the caching mechanisms to improve the site's speed and overall performance.

Implement News Feed Functionality: Begin working on the news feed feature, ensuring that posts are displayed in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.

I am grateful for any help or guidance in continuing the development of offeyicialchatroom and overcoming these challenges.
