This is my first social media site and I hope it goes well 
I am having issues with the sqlsrv and I dont even know what to do
I cant see my site and know if its working

24/02/23
I fixed sqlsrv error and also fixed other errors with connecting with databse using SQL login.
i fixed the error of not seeing the icons
and now everything looks finer and also made the news feed look a little bit finer
i will take care of the javascript of like share comment later
i need to read for school. 

Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function sqlsrv_connect() in C:\xampp\htdocs\offeyicialchatroom\db.php:5 Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\offeyicialchatroom\db.php on line 5
